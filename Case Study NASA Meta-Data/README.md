There are over 32,000 datasets hosted and/or maintained by NASA;.
These datasets cover topics from Earth science to aerospace engineering to management of NASA itself. 
We can use the metadata for these datasets to understand the connections between them.

The metadata includes information like the title of the dataset, a description field, what organization(s) within NASA is responsible for the dataset, 
keywords for the dataset that have been assigned by a human being, and so forth.
NASA places a high priority on making its data open and accessible, even requiring all NASA-funded research to be openly accessible online.
