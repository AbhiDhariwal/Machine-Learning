Gujarmal Modi 9 August 1902  22 January 1976 was an Indian industrialist and philanthropist, who co-established the Modi Group of companies and the industrial city of Modinagar in 1933, along with his brother Kedar Nath Modi

GM Modi established schools and colleges at his birthplace, Mahendragarh, in Patiala and in Modinagar
“Narendra Modi is forcing a war between India and Pakistan for his own political gains”
But now that Narendra Modi is setting a new trend, by retaliating every time an attack is done on India , they cannot understand why is Modi retaliating instead of following the same procedure done by the previous governments, they are stating it as “Narendra Modi is forcing a war between India and Pakistan for his own political gains”
And moreover Modi has got nothing to do with the war, he didn’t call for a war, Pakistan did
Modi didn’t call for the war, all he did is planned to take down terrorist camps in Balakot, and that’s what every country which feels that “terrorism is a threat to world peace and Pakistan is inefficient in stopping the terrorism” should do
In the first place Modi is not forcing any war between India and Pakistan, so their wont be any question about political gains
 Id totally agree with your statement, and even Modi know that and doesnt want to go to war with pakistan and that is the reason why he hasnt attacked pakistan or waged a full scale war against pakistan instead he choose to attack a terrorist base camp which happen to be located in Pakistan
And some people are stating that the incidents of Uri and Pulwama occurred because of Modi
“If not for Modi, those terror attacks would have occurred in middle of the country instead of places close to border or places close to Pok”
Ps- I have no intentions of politicising this matter and I know that credit for decresing the terror attacks in India goes to the Intelligence deparment and security forces of India and not the prime minister, i just want to state that putting the blame of every terror attack on Modi, like no terror attacks happened any other time and calling everyone who supports Modi as a bakth, isnt helping anyone
 And moreover blaming Modi all the time for everything bad ever happened in India is going to make you look cooler or stylish in no way dude
 Priyanka Vadra becomes Congress President
Edit To anyone who thinks Indiaor Modi is forcing a war, no, India is not
